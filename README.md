Project Description
This project is an Airbnb Clone Command Interpreter, a simplified version of the Airbnb application, designed to manage and interact with data related to property rentals. The command interpreter provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform various operations such as creating users, managing listings, handling bookings, and more.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based tool that allows users to interact with the Airbnb Clone system through a series of commands. It processes user input, executes corresponding actions, and communicates with the underlying data model to perform operations on users, listings, and bookings
