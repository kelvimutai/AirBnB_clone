### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Airbnb Clone  is a simplified version of the Airbnb application, designed to manage and interact with data related to property rentals. 
The command interpreter provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform various operations such as creating users, managing listings, handling bookings, and more.

### COMMAND INTERPRETER:
The command interpreter is a Python-based tool that allows users to interact with the Airbnb Clone system through a series of commands.
It processes user input, executes corresponding actions, and communicates with the underlying data model to perform operations on users, listings, and bookings
A command interpreter is a program that allows users to interact with an operating system or software application through textual commands and provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can input commands to perform various tasks.

### HOW TO START COMMAND INTERPRETER:

1. **Accessing the Command Line**: Depending on your operating system, you can typically access the command line by opening a terminal or command prompt application. 

2. **Launching the Interpreter**: Once you have a command-line interface open, you're typically already in the command interpreter environment. If not, you may need to enter the name of the command interpreter program (e.g., `cmd.exe` for Command Prompt on Windows).

### How to Use the Command Interpreter:

1. **Enter Commands**: You can start entering commands once you see the command prompt . Commands are typically structured as `command [options] [arguments]`.

2. **Execute Commands**: Press Enter after typing a command to execute it. The command interpreter will interpret the command and carry out the requested action.

3. **Interpret Output**: After executing a command, the interpreter may provide feedback or output. This could be error messages, status updates, or the result of the command's execution.

### some Examples of commands:
1. **Creating a remove Directory**:
   ```bash
   rmdir new_directory
 2.**Displaying System Information**:
   ```bash
   uname -a
3.**Removing a File**:
   ```bash
   rm file_to_remove


###Airbnb Project:
In an Airbnb project, the command interpreter might be used for various tasks such as managing user authentication, handling bookings, managing property listings, and customer support.
###Here are some  examples:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - `login username password`: it allows users to log in to their Airbnb account.
   - `register username email password`-it registers a new user account.

2. **Managing Property Listings**:
   - `listings`:it displays available property listings.
   - `add_listing property_details`and  `remove_listing property_id`: it adds a new property listing and removes a property listing respectively.
3. **Handling Bookings**:
   - `cancel_booking booking_id`: it cancels a previously made booking.

4. **Customer Support** - Providing assistance to users for any issues, disputes, or queries that may arise during the booking process or stay.
