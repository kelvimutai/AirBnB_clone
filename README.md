Project Description
This project is an Airbnb Clone Command Interpreter, a simplified version of the Airbnb application, designed to manage and interact with data related to property rentals. The command interpreter provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform various operations such as creating users, managing listings, handling bookings, and more.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based tool that allows users to interact with the Airbnb Clone system through a series of commands. It processes user input, executes corresponding actions, and communicates with the underlying data model to perform operations on users, listings, and bookings
A command interpreter, also known as a command-line interpreter or shell, is a program that allows users to interact with an operating system or software application through textual commands. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can input commands to perform various tasks.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter:

1. **Accessing the Command Line**: Depending on your operating system, you can typically access the command line by opening a terminal or command prompt application. For example:
   - On Windows: You can open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On macOS: You can open Terminal.
   - On Linux: You can open Terminal or any terminal emulator.

2. **Launching the Interpreter**: Once you have a command-line interface open, you're typically already in the command interpreter environment. If not, you may need to enter the name of the command interpreter program (e.g., `cmd.exe` for Command Prompt on Windows, `bash` for the Bash shell on Linux).

### How to Use the Command Interpreter:

1. **Enter Commands**: You can start entering commands once you see the command prompt (`$` on Linux/macOS, `>` on Windows). Commands are typically structured as `command [options] [arguments]`.

2. **Execute Commands**: Press Enter after typing a command to execute it. The command interpreter will interpret the command and carry out the requested action.

3. **Interpret Output**: After executing a command, the interpreter may provide feedback or output. This could be error messages, status updates, or the result of the command's execution.

### Examples:

1. **Listing Files in a Directory**:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

2. **Creating a New Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir new_directory
   ```

3. **Copying a File**:
   ```bash
   cp source_file destination
   ```

4. **Moving/Renaming a File**:
   ```bash
   mv old_file new_location
   ```

5. **Removing a File**:
   ```bash
   rm file_to_remove
   ```

6. **Displaying System Information**:
   ```bash
   uname -a
   ```

7. **Navigating Between Directories**:
   ```bash
   cd directory_path
   ```

### Airbnb Project:

For an Airbnb project, the command interpreter might be used for various tasks such as managing user authentication, handling bookings, managing property listings, and interacting with the database. Here are some hypothetical examples:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - `login username password`: Allows users to log in to their Airbnb account.
   - `register username email password`: Registers a new user account.

2. **Managing Property Listings**:
   - `listings`: Displays available property listings.
   - `add_listing property_details`: Adds a new property listing.
   - `remove_listing property_id`: Removes a property listing.

3. **Handling Bookings**:
   - `book property_id checkin_date checkout_date`: Books a property for a specific duration.
   - `cancel_booking booking_id`: Cancels a previously made booking.

4. **Database Interaction**:
   - `query_database query`: Executes a custom SQL query on the Airbnb database.
   - `backup_database destination_path`: Creates a backup of the Airbnb database.

These are just hypothetical examples. In a real Airbnb project, the commands and functionalities would be more extensive and tailored to the specific requirements of the application.
